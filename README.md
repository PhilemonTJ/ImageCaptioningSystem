# ImageCaptioningSystem

## 📜 Overview

ImageCaptioningSystem is a Python-based application that generates descriptive captions for images using deep learning techniques. By leveraging pre-trained neural networks, the system interprets the content of images and produces relevant textual descriptions.

## ✨ Features

- **Automated Image Captioning:** Generates descriptive captions for input images.
- **Deep Learning Models:** Utilizes pre-trained models for image analysis and caption generation.
- **Multiple Caption Styles:** Supports General, Creative, Professional, Descriptive, and Quote-based captions.
- **Text Overlay on Image:** Allows users to overlay the selected caption on the image.
- **Audio Output:** Generates speech for each caption using text-to-speech (TTS).
